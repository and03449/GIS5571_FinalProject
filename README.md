Problem Statement

Glacier melt accounts for 21% of the annual sea-level rise with an increase of 6-19% each decade (Hugonnet et al., 2021). The observed sea-level rise is approximately 0.12 - 0.14 inches per year, which may not seem like an incredibly significant amount however it amounts to approximately 6 inches since 1950 with it rapidly increasing each year (US EPA, 2016a). Glacial melt is observed in two different ways: surface area of the glacier and volume of ice in the glacier. Using satellite imagery from Planet Explorer I will compare surface area over time using two different methods of two known-receding glaciers - Vatnajökullin SE Iceland and Gulkana in Alaska, USA - using Planet imagery.

Methods

Using Calculated Fields and Compute Change I will estimate the change in glacial melt over a six year time frame (2017 - 2022) for two glaciers: Gulkana Glacier in Alaska and Breiðamerkurjökull Glacier in SE Iceland.
